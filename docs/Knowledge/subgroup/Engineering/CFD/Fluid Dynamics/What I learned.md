# What I learned
This is a page about what I learned about Fluid Dyanmics from CFD.

## Conditions of Bernoulli Equation
High pressure - low velocity / low pressure - high velocity relationship from Bernoulli equation can only be used in below conditions;
* No viscosity (same as no friction)
* Steady
* Flow along a streamline 
* Incompressible flow
