[15 Youtube Videos explaining about history of Fluid Dynamics - in Korean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv8phdMB5XA&list=PLFs8qkZ9PQlc_shO4UO0OfngzK7tE7H6U&index=18)
<br> These youtube videos are explained by an Engineer, Taegee Min. [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taegee-min-6431367/?originalSubdomain=kr)
<br> Actually these 15 videos are based on his book, Panta Rhei.
<br> Unfortunately, it is written in Korean.
<br> I'm sure this is a damn good book to recommend.
<br> Please read it.
