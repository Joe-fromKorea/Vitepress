# Flow around a cylinder

## ANSYS
In ANSYS Fluent, I conducted several simuations.

* steady flow (at low Reynolds # (Re=20), equivalant to laminar flow)
<details>
<summary> unsteady flow (at high Reynolds #) </summary>

* $$Re=120$$
* $$Re={10}^6$$
* Different Mesh
* Not patched (IDK what it fully means)

</details>

## Paper

Catalano, Pietro, Meng Wang, Gianluca Iaccarino, and Parviz Moin. "**Numerical simulation of the flow around a circular cylinder at high Reynolds numbers.**" International journal of heat and fluid flow 24, no. 4 (2003): 463-469

## Remaining Questions

<details>
<summary> What is patching? </summary>

According to instructions, I had to 'patch' the flow so that it can reach vortex shedding fast.
IDK what it means, and I didn't have time to conduct simulation again without 'patch' and compare with the one with it.
