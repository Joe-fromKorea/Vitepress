# Navier-Stokes Equation

Navier-Stokes Equation is one of the most elegant and interesting equation.
<br> It shows how fluid moves.
<br> This is damn intersting.
<br> Just one single equation can show how river flows, how air pass by the airplane, how the coffee whirls inside your cup, how wave crashes - all those chaotic motion of fluid.

<br> I'm going to explain how this equation is formed and what it means.

<br> Btw, this is one of the $7M questions - so it means it's mathmatically really difficult and complex to solve.
<br> As we're not mathmatician, it's enough to derive, understand and use it somewhere else - bc I'm an engineer.
