## About
This page is about neuroscience, and applying those knowledge to my real life.

I had a class in NYU called 'Science of Happiness' which focuses on college students well being and mental health

It covers positive thinking, sleep, nutrition, decision making, exercise which can be and is related to wellness of college students based on scientific research.

Two professors are instructors, Dan holds Masters degree on phychology and Alan is psychiatrist. So, they are reliable and professionals.
<br>

## Purpose
There were a lot of interesting topics in this class, so I wanted to make a page about it.

Also, there are many good neuroscientists out there, including Andrew Huberman.
<br>[Andrew Huberman Youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab)
<br>He is one of the most famous neuroscientists right now. (2023)

So I wanted to consolidate all the knowledge and tips in this page so that I can implement it.

## Structure
The page is consisted of [Fact](/docs/Knowledge/subgroup/Neuroscience/Fact.md), [Applying](/docs/Knowledge/subgroup/Neuroscience/Implementation.md) and [Question](/docs/Knowledge/subgroup/Neuroscience/Question.md)
