## About
**The Magic Flute** (German: Die Zauberflöte, pronounced [diː ˈtsaʊbɐˌfløːtə]), K. 620, is an opera in two acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to a German libretto(Text works) by Emanuel Schikaneder.
<br> It was premiered(first performance) in 1791, September, just 3 months before Mozard died.
<br> The work is in the form of a Singspiel, a popular form during the time it was written that included both singing and spoken dialogue.

The story itself might be childish, but it is full of subversive symbolism and has so many good arias and is regarded as one of the most influencial operas in history.
<br> The most famous aria is "Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen" (Hell's vengeance boils in my heart) which is commonly referred to as just "The Queen of the Night's aria". It is one of the most difficult aria to sing, and is widely known to people.

## How to enjoy
The most imporatnt thing is **Know the story, Know the music**.
<br>Opera is a combination of story and music, but most of the operas are written in Italian or German, so it is impossible to understand the whole story from the beginning.

Also, number 3 appears so many time in the Magic Flute.
<br> It is because Mozart was part of Premaison, and they believed 3 is the most stable number.
<br> This might be seemed as conspiracy theory, but it is regarded as true for many experts.
