# **About**

## Puprpose
The **primary** purpose of this website is for uploading all my knowledges. 
<br>As we are living in knowledge-based era, we cannot memorize all the knowledges in our brain nor we need to.
<br>That's why I'm saving all my knowledges through this website

Someone might ask, 'Hey, can't you just save your knowledges in your own notebook or Word documentation?
<br>My answer is "Yes of course I can, but *it's more fun to share knowledges with people* as I am the curious man, and by uploading it, *my website can help people.*"

Here comes my **secondary** purpose.
<br>To share accurate knowledges.
<br>There are tons of knowledges out in the internet.
<br>But you know it's not all truthworthy.
<br>some of them might be false, some might be ads.
<br>In this website, you will see substantially accurate information as I am making this website just for my personal purpose.
<br>I will mark **the updated date** and **references.**
<br>This wil help you to judge you could rely on the documentation or not.

::: warning
**There might be inaccurate information in this website.
<br>Please rely on your judgement rather than following it blindly**
