# Experiences
This page if for what I experienced when I was staying in New York and also taking classes at NYU.

## Class
I initially took 5 courses; Compressible Flow, Measurement Systems, Numerical Analysis, Science of Happiness and History in the Headlines.
<br> But I withdrawled History in the Headlines because it wasn't that meaningful than I expected.
