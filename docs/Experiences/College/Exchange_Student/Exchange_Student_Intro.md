# Studying as an Exchange Student at NYU

## About an Exchange Student Program
### What is an Exchange Student Program?
Exchange Student Program is little different from studying abroad.
<br>If you just study overseas, that's studying abroad.
<br>Exchange Student Program is more specific than studying abroad.
<br>Your school and your partner's school had an agreement to 'exchange' their students to provide an opportunity to study abroad.

### Tuition and Expenses?
You don't have to pay tuition for your partner school, and you can also transfer credits back to home university after studying at exchange school.
<br>
<br>So I didn't pay NYU tuition, which is 6 times more expensive than our tuition!! **HAHA**
<br>But still, I had to pay for housing, food, health insurance, and all the other stuffs exepct for tuition.
<br>Some students get government or private scholarship, but it's not a case for all students. 

### How Long?
Exchange Students usually study one or two semesters at their partner's school.
<br>It depends on people how long they want to study there.
<br>As I'm in mechanical engeering, I had to go back and study core courses, so I just stayed for a semester.
<br>But Some of my friends stayed one year.
