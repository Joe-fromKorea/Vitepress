## Housing
### Intro
I really struggled a lot to find a housing.
<br> As of January 2024, the average rent in NYC, is $3,055 per month for a studio according to [Apartment.com](https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/new-york-ny/#:~:text=As%20of%20January%202024%2C%20the,for%20a%20two%2Dbedroom%20apartment.) 
<br> Average rent in Brooklyn is $2,478 per month.
<br> It was really hard for me to find a place to live while I was in Korea.
<br> I had to find a place to live just by searching internet and New York is the city where I've never been.

<br>However, I really learned a lot from this process, so I wanted to document it.

### Step 1. Prioritizing
Prioritize the things you consider and narrow it down because there are so many apartments and so many hoods.
For me it was,
1. Price - under $1,800/month
2. Location - not far away from NYU Tandon Campus (Less than 15min in subway)
3. Safety - doesn't have to be super safe, but not sketchy.
4. Reliability - try my best to avoid scams.

<br> But the problem was I had to find a place while I'm in Korea.
<br> How do I know the neighborhood is safe?
<br> How can I rely on someone that I never met?
<br> Actually, I could have been scammed by some random email. Luckily, I found that the passport of the landlord was edited, so I wasn't scammed.
<br> So I decided to stay in Airbnb for a month and then find a place to live. 

### Ways to avoid scams
1. **Be careful to contact with someone who emailed you at the first place instead of using websites or platforms.** <br>Because they will not be tracked if they use email.<br>This is from my experience.
2. **Try to take an in-person tour.** <br>I don't recommend virtual tour, because there's a chance that the apartment might be the one that never existed.<br>Also, you can check a lot of things by looking with your two eyes;if the apartment smells bad or not, if it is clean, etc.<br>Renting a house without taking a tour is like getting into relationship with someone who you never met.
3. **Check the personal status of the landlord** <br>If you can find the information of the landlord in facebook, linkedin or instagram and if the landlord has normal job, there's a low chance that you will be scammed. <br>But this isn't necessary. 
4. **After you have the key or the passcode of the apartment, you're safe**, <br>Eventhough you signed the contract with the landlord, you still have chance to be scammed bc landlord might had made
